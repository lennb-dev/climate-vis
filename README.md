# 🌍 Global Environmental Data Visualization

An interactive web application developed with Vue 3 and D3.js that visualizes global environmental data through dynamic world maps. The application provides insights into climate change, CO₂ emissions, and renewable energy usage across different countries. Developed by Lennard Beer & Marc Simon Curcic

## Main Components

### 1. Data Switcher
   - **Data Switcher**: Toggle between different environmental datasets (e.g., CO₂, temperature, renewables) to update the map display.
   - **CO₂ Emissions**: Display and comparison of country-level CO₂ emissions over time.
   - **CO₂ Emissions per Capita**: Display and comparison of CO₂ emissions per capita across different countries over time.
   - **Temperature**: Visualization of global temperature changes and anomalies in different countries (compared to the mean of the temperatures from 1991-2020).
   - **Share of Renewable Energy**: Representation of the percentage of renewable energy in total energy consumption by country.
   - **Share of Renewable Electricity**: Display of electricity generation from renewable sources, compared to the overall electricity consumption.

### 2. World Map Visualization  
- **Color-Encoded Heatmap**: Countries are shaded based on dataset values using custom thresholds.  
- **Custom Thresholds**: Each dataset defines custom scale domains to ensure visual clarity across varying value ranges.
- **Interactive Legend**: Automatically updates with the selected data layer, providing context for color-value mappings.

### 3. Timeslider  
   - **Timeslider**: Select any year to view corresponding data.
   - **Playback Control**: Animate the timeline from the selected year to the dataset’s end using play/pause functionality.

### 4. Tooltips  
- **Hover Details**: Hover over a country to display a line chart showing its historical data for the selected dataset, using dynamic colors that match the current legend scale.
- **Legend Interaction**: Hovering over legend entries highlights all countries within that threshold range on the map.
- **Country Dashboard**: Clicking a country opens a detailed dashboard view with extended statistics and charts.

### 5. Country Dashboard

- **Multi-Dataset Line Chart**: Visualizes all available datasets for the selected country over the full time range. Users can:
  - Adjust the **start year** with a slider below the chart.
  - Toggle individual datasets on/off via buttons.
  - Temperature data is plotted on a separate °C axis, while CO₂, Renewable Energy Share, and Renewable Electricity Share are shown on a 0–100% scale.  
  - CO₂ emissions are min-max normalized per country for better comparative scaling.
  - Hover over the line chart to get exact values at the respective year.

- **CO₂ Emissions by Sector (Donut Chart)**: Displays the distribution of CO₂ emissions across sectors (e.g., transport, industry, energy).  
  - Hovering over a sector highlights it in the legend and shows the percentage share inside the donut.

- **Electricity Share over Time (Stacked Line Chart)**: Shows the evolution of electricity generation from different sources (e.g., fossil, hydro, solar, wind) over time.  
  - Focuses only on domestically produced electricity, excluding imports.

## Technology Stack

- **Vue 3**: Frontend framework with Composition API and `<script setup>`
- **Vite**: Modern frontend development environment
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility‑first styling framework for fast, responsive design directly in Vue 3 templates 
- **D3.js**: Data visualization library
- **ChartJS**: Stacked line chart visualisation
- **CSV and GeoJSON**: Data sources for environmental metrics and geographical information

## Getting Started

1. Clone repository
2. Install node.js and npm (windows: https://nodejs.org/en)
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Data Sources

The application uses various datasets, including:
- Geographic world data (GeoJSON: https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector)

- CO₂ emissions per capita (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita)
- Temperature anomaly data (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-temperature-anomalies)
- Renewable energy statistics (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-final-energy-consumption-from-renewable-sources)
- Renewable electricity statistics (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-electricity-renewables)
- CO₂ emissions by sector (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-by-sector)
